* Scope of this document



* Configuration

* Deployment

Once App Runner is set up, pushing a new Docker image will restart the server.

bin/build.sh does all the necessary steps

** Preconditions
- Docker must be running
- AWS cred must be in place
- emacs available from shell


* AWS Services

These were all cobbled together by hand, I suppose the TODO is to make a CloudFormation them.

** Datomic Cloud

** App Runner

** ECR (Container Registry)

** IAM 

** TODO storage service for library
